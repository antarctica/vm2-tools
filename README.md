## Overview

This is an old repository that is very useful for those developing with the VM2 microcontroller on Linux (or without the IDE)

## Commands

* code_uploader: uploads code on boot of the controller from the named project file

## Next steps

This is something not worked on for years, but definitely useful to be in the public domain for anyone using this controller. Perhaps there are more utilities to be made, which may spur more development. Appreciate this is a bit unstructured at present!
